      <h3>About Dover Community Radio</h3>
<p>Founded in 2010 DCR is a local online community radio station run entirely by volunteers and covering White Cliffs Country including the towns of Dover, Deal, Sandwich and surrounding communities</p>

<p>DCR now produces over 40 hours of dedicated programming 7 days a week, evenings and weekends, often including local musicians, sometimes playing live in the studio and tries to offer a local News coverage. At all other times we offer DCR Non-Stop, a pre-recorded selection of music and interviews.</p>

<p>In November / December 2012 DCR successfully completed our first 28 day FM licence on 87.7FM which included our first ever Live-to-Air Outside Broadcast.</p>

<p>Our focus is not only to encourage a sense of community within the area but also to positively promote White Cliffs Country to visitors.</p>

<p>Dover Community Radio is a registered CIC company dedicated to helping provide a radio station for the Dover District. Our aim is to provide an opportunity for anyone interested in radio and the community to become involved with the radio station.</p>

<p>Many of our presenters were introduced into broadcasting by DCR using our training studio, facilities and experience.  Anyone from within the District interested in getting into broadcasting is welcome to visit our studios and explore opportunities and ideas.</p>

<p>DCR also needs help from others to help with promotion, the technical running of the station or outside events, fund raising and all the other vital roles that go towards running a successful radio station.</p>
 
<p>Press Releases, Event Details and other relevant announcements are always welcome at DCR and we will always try our best to include them within our output.</p>

      <h3>Get Involved</h3>
<p>DCR encourages the involvement of the White Cliffs Community. Send us your Press Releases and notice of events, musicians send us your tracks and gig listings. Or better still: DO IT YOURSELF. Many of the presenters on DCR learned 'how to' by using our training facilities and learning from the experience of others.</p>

<p>We especially invite help in growing our local News and Sports coverage, even if you can only spare 15 minutes a week you can tell us about your village, group or team. We always welcome non presenters too, studio engineers, sound techs and all the other people that can help keep us On Air or run our various Live Events.</p>

<p>Maybe youre studying for a career in broadcasting, we can help you gain important, hands on, experience. Or maybe youv've always wanted to 'have a go' in which case come and have a chat. Then there's the ever important role of Fund Raising, OFCOM, PRS, PPL and the like all require us to be fully licensed and that costs money.</p>

<p>If you can help with selling advertising, running fund raising events and campaigns or talking with funding bodies we would love to hear from you. There are many ways to get involved.</p>

<p>Please e-mail us studio@dcrfm.co.uk if you would like to "Get Involved"</p>
